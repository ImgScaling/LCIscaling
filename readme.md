LAGRANGE-CHEBYSHEV INTERPOLATION FOR IMAGE RESIZING


SOFTWARE

The source code of LCI (Lagrange-Chebyshev Interpolation) method, proposed in the paper "Lagrange-Chebyshev Interpolation for image resizing", Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, ISSN: 0378-4754, DOI: 10.1016/j.matcom.2022.01.017, vol. 197, pp. 105 – 126, 2022, by D. Occorsio, G. Ramella, W. Themistoclakis, is intended to support the possibility of comparison by other authors. 

To run the method, simply run the demo_LCI.m. Note that it is an educational code that is not optimized for speed.

DATASETS

The validation of the LCI method has been carried out on several kinds of 8-bit color images collected in six publicly available datasets, having different characteristics on the size and the quality of the images, the variety of subjects, etc. The employed datasets are synthesized in the following table comprising 1026 images in total.

These datasets are available by the link indicated in the table. The dataset named PEXELS300 has been obtained by selecting 300 images from PEXELS (www.pexels.com/search/color/) that provides a free using and downloading library containing over 3.2 million photos and videos, growing each month by roughly 200,000 files. Its content is uploaded by the users and reviewed manually. The 300 images taken from this dataset, originally with a different large size, have been centrally cropped by 1800x1800 pixels. PEXELS300 is available here with the aim to support the possibility of comparison by other authors.
